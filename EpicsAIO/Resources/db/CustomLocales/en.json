I tell you what, we can kick this thing off if you can whack some of the local upstarts who think they're something just because they have a rusted shitty kalash. Got some American green in it for you if you can paint the street with ten of them.",

Well listen here fuckstick, I don't take kindly to strangers so what do you want? That look on your face gives me the idea you know about as much of what's going on as me. Well here, take a seat and we can talk about the situation I'm in before you give your side.",

Now don't take me for a lazy bastard, I swear I've looked all over for this shit before I bothered asking you. Maybe I'm just not looking in the right places, who fucking knows, I'm not from here. But I want some sausage and crackers. It would just be nice. I wouldn't consider this a need, but if you come across some in your travels it would be appreciated. Thanks.",

I figure you can see that I'm not in that great of sorts as of lately and I'd appreciate your help in helping me solve some of my issues. I know they're my issues to solve, but just given that you've been around for longer than me, I'm sure you know the neighborhoods much better than I. There are some drunkards who have been rooting through my shit lately and don't care what I threaten them with, so I hope you'd be okay taking some more of them out. The payment will be much more generous this time. This time though, bring me their weapons as proof they're dead. And here's a freebie if you can use it, seeing as you're working for me. Thanks again.",

A visitor from the west was vacationing here just prior to the conflict and overstayed his welcome in Tarkov and got stuck in the bear trap. Him and I have been discussing quite a lot though, and I think we could all use his connections and skills. He worked on firearms back home professionally, you understand?
